# 🧠 Electron Application Transformation (Reverse Engineering Project)

**Duration:** August 2025  
**Role:** Application Reverse-engineer (Independent Project)

---

## 📘 Overview
Performed a complete transformation and rebranding of a paid cross-platform desktop application originally requiring a **$20/month subscription**, converting it into a **fully self-managed, cost-free version** through reverse engineering and custom integration work.

---

## 🚀 Achievements

- Converted a **$20/month paid tool** into a **zero-cost self-hosted system**.  
- Achieved **100% feature retention** while removing proprietary dependencies.  
- Enhanced application performance, startup time, and fault tolerance.  
- Ensured compatibility across **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.  

---

## 🔧 Key Contributions

- **Reverse-engineered and unlocked** a commercial Electron-based desktop application to operate fully offline without recurring subscription or license requirements.  
- **Rebuilt AI-driven modules** using personal API credentials, removing dependencies on paid proxy services.  
- Successfully **dismantled and re-integrated** all AI components with direct, self-managed implementations:
  - **AssemblyAI** – real-time streaming transcription  
  - **Deepgram** – multi-language transcription engine  
  - **Gladia** – WebSocket-based real-time transcription  
  - **OpenAI** – fallback transcription and reasoning engine  
- **Redesigned global shortcut architecture** for improved accessibility and system-level compatibility.  
- **Implemented secure API handling** with efficient WebSocket streaming and real-time event management.  
- **Integrated multi-platform screen capture support** with fallback and recovery mechanisms.  
- Authored **comprehensive technical documentation** covering architecture analysis, re-engineering methodology, and executable build pipeline.
